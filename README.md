I am a meticulous and resolute Computer Engineer. I like designing something by myself and working on projects with people who motivate me. I pay a lot of attention to details and I always delve in what I do. I would like to exploit my desire and my ability to design software and systems in general to contribute to the technological progress, putting into effect ideas that will change our lives.
